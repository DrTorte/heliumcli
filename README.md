# Helium CLI

## Prerequisites

* Python (>= 3.5)
* Pip (>= 9.0)

## Getting Started

The Helium CLI can easily be included in a compatible project by simply cloning the repo into your project's `lib`
folder and creating a symlink to the `helium-cli` executable in `bin`.

More detailed installation and customization instructions, including how to ensure you have a compatible project,
check out the the [Helium CLI Wiki](https://github.com/HeliumEdu/heliumcli/wiki). For example usage, see
Helium's [deploy](https://github.com/HeliumEdu/deploy) project, which utilizes this tool.
