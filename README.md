# Helium CLI

## Prerequisites

* Python (>=2.7, >= 3.5)
* Pip (>= 9.0)

## Getting Started

The Helium CLI can easily be included in a compatible project by simply cloning the repo into your project's `lib`
folder and creating a symlink to the `helium-cli` executable in `bin`. The `helium-cli` is foremost compatible with Git codebases deployed using Ansible, though both of these factors could be extended relatively easily to support other tools as well.

More detailed installation and customization instructions, including how to ensure you have a compatible project,
check out the the [Helium CLI Wiki](https://github.com/HeliumEdu/heliumcli/wiki).
